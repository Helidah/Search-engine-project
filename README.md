# Search-engine-project
## Description
This is a simple search engine program that web scrapes a few websites and returns links and image results based on the key words typed in. 

## Installation
Clone this repository into your working directory. Run a PHPMyAdmin website to connect to the SQL database.

## Usage
Runs in  interactive mode.

## The Experience
It was exciting to finally figure out how a search engine works. I had never thought about how google and other search engines provided information to my screen with just a few clicks. My favourite part of the project was designing the web scrapper and being able to access websites and store their data. That was quite fascinating for me.
